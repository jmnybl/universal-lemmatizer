# universal-lemmatizer

A neural sequence-to-sequence model for lemmatization using OpenNMT and pytorch libraries.

The Universal Lemmatizer is part of the Turku-neural-parser-pipeline (https://turkunlp.github.io/Turku-neural-parser-pipeline/) with pre-trained models for more than 50 languages, and state-of-the-art lemmatization results in the CoNLL-18 Shared Task on Parsing Universal Dependencies. See TurkuNLP entry at http://universaldependencies.org/conll18/results-lemmas.html.

Needs python3 environment with pytorch installed.
